# Toralia - Official Modpack Season 2

A Vanilla+ Forge modpack focused on immersion, QoL, and performance.
It expands the world with new creatures like sharks, and a wide variety of fishes, introduces fresh ores, immersive armor sets, backpacks, refined boss fights, and biome enhancements.
Visual and audio improvements such as Fresh Animations, Complementary Shaders, Presence Footsteps, enhanced sound physics, dynamic lights, and smooth GUIs make the game feel richer without breaking the classic Minecraft atmosphere.
On top of that, the modpack is heavily optimized with ModernFix, FerriteCore, Embeddium, AllTheLeaks, FastQuit, and many others to ensure excellent performance and quick loading, even with all the added features.
